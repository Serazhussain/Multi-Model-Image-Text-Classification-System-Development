The Task:

I had to make a computer tool that could sort pictures into five different groups. The interesting part was that each picture came with some text. This gave me an idea: What if I could use both the picture and its text to make decisions?

The Steps I Took: Getting to Know the Data:

I had a set of 2,500 pictures, and each picture had a piece of text linked to it. After seeing this, I thought it would be best to use both types of data for better accuracy.

Building the Tool:

For the pictures, I used a system known as a CNN. This system is known for being good at identifying patterns in images. The text was handled using a different system that can process and understand written words. I then combined the outputs of both these systems to make a final sorting decision.

Organizing the Data:

I adjusted the pictures so that they were of a consistent quality and size. For the text, I made sure all the words were organized and easy for the computer to read. Training the Tool:

Using the organized data, I then started teaching the tool how to sort the pictures. I kept checking its performance regularly to ensure it was learning correctly. Testing How Good the Tool Was:

Once the tool was trained, I tested it to see how accurate it was. I also made a chart that showed which pictures were sorted correctly and which ones weren't.

Why I Chose This Method: By using both pictures and their linked text, I believed the tool could make better decisions. While pictures show visual patterns, text can have important details that the picture might miss.

Challenges:

Dealing with Text: Organizing and preparing the text was a bit challenging. Building the Tool: Combining two different systems (one for pictures and one for text) was new and a bit complex. Time: The process was time-consuming, especially because I was using two types of data.

Looking Back: If I had more time, I'd play around with other methods to see if I could get even better results. Using more advanced systems for reading the text might have been helpful too.
